ABOTS: A Bunch Of Tiny Scripts
==============================

The name of this project explains what it is, a bunch of tiny scripts. 
I find myself thinking of many different projects that all require some core 
functionality that many other projects can share.
However, it must be laid down first before adding the "unique" code that my 
ideas consist of.
The usual approach to this issue is using an existing framework someone else 
wrote, but then you need to understand how that framework does things and fit 
your application to fit that mindset.
As well, you now have this black box in your application that you do not 100% 
understand and adds another layer of abstraction that makes debugging issues 
that much harder (we all make bugs, so do framework devs).

With that being said, ideologically I do not like using existing frameworks 
since that deprives me of the opportunity to learn how that particular piece of 
software works.
So ABOTS is my approach of making a shared library of code that I want to use 
in other projects.
Any improvements here can then improve my other projects, as well as give me 
something small to work on when I am in-between projects that could eventually 
be useful later on.

The ideas of these scripts are to be as modular as possible so that they can be 
used in a variety of different projects with little changes needed.
Due to the nature of the project, this will probably not be too useful for 
other developers who are not me, but it could be useful to see how a particular 
component of ABOTS works since the project is optimized more towards 
versitlity and simplicity than being the most efficient way of doing something 
at the expense of being harder to understand.

Now that you know what lies here, proceed with caution.
You have been warned.
