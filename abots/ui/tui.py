ui\TUI: Text User Interface
===========================

The curses library is one of those things I always wanted to use, but never got 
around to it.
That ends here, as this script will try to take curses and abstract it into a 
nice framework I can re-use without needing to pull out a manual for curses to 
figure out exactly what everything does (which is what I will be doing during 
the duration of writing this script).
